# Orca PVA
Matlab code and data for a population viability analysis of the Southern Resident Orca Population. Originally developed in December 2008 for an ecological modeling course at the University of Helsinki.

The Southern Resident population, because of its small size and genetic isolation, is believed to be the most threatened of the five Northeast Pacific resident populations and has been listed and has been listed as endangered under the U.S.A. Endangered Species Act and the Canadian Species at Risk Act.
